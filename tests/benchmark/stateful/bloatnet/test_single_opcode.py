abstract: BloatNet single-opcode benchmark cases for state-related operations.

   These tests focus on individual EVM opcodes (SLOAD, SSTORE) to measure
   their performance when accessing many storage slots across pre-deployed
   contracts. Unlike multi-opcode tests, these isolate single operations
   to benchmark specific state-handling bottlenecks.

#                 1. Generate random address from counter
#                 2. CALL balanceOf(random_address) → forces cold SLOAD
#                 3. Most addresses have zero balance → empty storage slots
#
# WHY IT STRESSES CLIENTS:
#   - Each balanceOf() call forces a cold SLOAD on a likely-empty slot
#   - Storage slot = keccak256(address || balances_slot)
#   - Random addresses ensure maximum cache misses
#   - Tests client's sparse storage handling efficiency

#                 2. CALL approve(counter, counter) → forces cold SSTORE
#                 3. Writes to new allowance slots in sparse storage
#
# WHY IT STRESSES CLIENTS:
#   - Each approve() call forces an SSTORE to a new storage slot
#   - Storage slot = keccak256(
#       msg.sender || keccak256(spender || allowances_slot)
#     )
#   - Sequential counter ensures unique storage locations
#   - Tests client's ability to handle many storage writes
#   - Simulates real-world contract state accumulation over time
